# Clean and stage the date.  The .csv file was downloaded from the NOAA website
# @ https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov.  The selection criteria was 'Cod, Atlantic' for
# seven New England states, from 1988 to 2017.  Using Excel, the original file
# was then modified as follows: a) the Conf column was removed, b) all of the 
# column (variable) names were set to lower-case, and c) the pounds and dollars
# columns were formatted as numbers.  The raw data was formatted as currency, 
# using commas as separators.  This last step is mandatory.  Otherwise, the
# load_csv function will import these columns as strings rather than numbers.
# The code below adds a new tons column to the dataframe and then saves it as
# a .csv file.  This, then, becomes our new base dataset, the one we work with
# from this point forward.  N.B. This only needs to be done once!

# Pivot the data set from long to wide format to view tons caught for each  
# state by year.  Compare numbers from late 1980's to present.  The grouping
# and summing operation is necessary because the NOAA supplied data set often
# has multiple observations for a given state in a given year.  The pounds and
# dollars columns are removed as they are not needed.

# Viewing data in a table gives us an initial sense of catch sizes over time.
# An inspection of the numbers suggests that there have been some dramatic
# declines in catches from the late 1980's.  Let's plot the data for one state
# (Massachussetts) to get a sense of what's happening.
