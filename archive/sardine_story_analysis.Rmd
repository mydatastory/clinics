Wendy needs your help to figure out what may have contributed to the collapse of the California sardine industry in 1953. She has limited time to figure out the answer and share her results with her grandfather so the assistance of Acme Data Consulting and you is important! Let's start off by understanding the research questions that Wendy has for the sardine data. 

## Research Questions

![](../assets/web_lesson_graphics/wendy/head_thinking.svg){width=100px; height=100px}

1. What is the relationship between the sardine catch and ocean temperature during peak spawning season?

2. How can I predict the sardine landings (total sardine catch) using ocean temperature data?

---

## Environment setup and loading datasets  

![](../assets/web_lesson_graphics/datadog/body_laserpointer.svg){width=100px; height=100px}

The first dataset that Wendy has from her grandfather is ocean temperature readings from La Jolla, CA. The other dataset contains sardine landings in tons. Sardine landings are the total number of sardines that were caught each year. Now, let's get started with my favorite part, programming! As Dr. DataDog, I'm here to help you write code that is perfectly flawless!

```{r data setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Load dplyr package (make sure it is installed first).
library(dplyr) 

setwd("C:/stories/_fish")

# Read in ocean temperature dataset.
temps_df <- read.csv('../data/scripps_ocean_temps.csv') 

# Read in sardine landings dataset.
landings_df <- read.csv('../data/sardine_landings_ueber.csv') 

```

## Data cleaning

![](../assets/web_lesson_graphics/datadog/body_pointing.svg){width=100px; height=100px}

Now that we have the data imported into R, we can start the first part of every good code program, the data cleaning process. Wendy explained to me based on her conversation with her grandfather that the onset of sardine spawning begins in February. This means that we need to create a subset of the temperature data from February to April. This dataset will be the peak spawning season. Then we will create a new dataset that contains the average temperatures for each year of the peak spawning season.

---

## Code for Data Cleaning

![](../assets/web_lesson_graphics/datadog/body_laserpointer.svg){width=100px; height=100px}

Using the subset command and then grouping the data to calculate the mean for each year is the way that I write my code to be accurate and clean. I never want to lose important data points when data cleaning!

```{r sardine_1}

temps_df <- temps_df[,-5]         # Remove 5th column b/c all missing data 
temps_df <- na.omit(temps_df)     # Remove any other missing data observations

# Create a subset using the month variable for Feb, March, and April.
temps_df <- subset(temps_df, month == 2 | month == 3 | month == 4) 

# Create another subset for years less than 1968.
temps_df <- subset(temps_df, year < 1968) 

avg_temps_df <- temps_df %>%                   # Call the dataset.
                  group_by(year) %>%           # Group the observations by year.
                  summarize(mean(surf_temp_c)) # Calculate the mean ocean temperature by year.

colnames(avg_temps_df)[2] <- "avg_temp"        # Name the column avg_temp.
```

## Graphing the data

![](../assets/web_lesson_graphics/datadog/body_laserpointer.svg){width=100px; height=100px}

Now that our code is perfect and we have a dataset that contains average ocean temperatures by year, we need to create a graph to see what is going on in the data. Let's create a graph with the year on the x-axis and the average ocean temperature on the y-axis.  

```{r sardine_2}

plot(avg_temps_df$year, avg_temps_df$avg_temp, # x-axis, y-axis.                  
     type = "l",                               # Type of graph is a line graph ("l" for lines).
     col  = "blue",                            # Color of the lines.
     main = "Temperature (Celsius) by Year",   # Overall title for the plot.
     xlim = c(1915, 1970),                     # Range of values for the x-axis.
     xlab = "Year",                            # Label for the x-axis.
     ylab = "Temperature (Celsius)")           # Label for the y-axis.

```

Voila, you're a coding genius just like me! Let's keep coding and move onto predicting the sardine landings. 

![](../assets/web_lesson_graphics/wendy/head_thinking.svg){width=100px; height=100px}

Hold on, DataDog! Not so fast, let's take a closer look at this graph.

As a consultant with Acme Data Consulting, what are your thoughts about the graph with temperature by year?

1. What do you observe from this line graph?

2. Does the temperature of the ocean change over the years? If so, how?

3. Are you able to identify an overall trend from this line graph?

## Graphing the data

![](../assets/web_lesson_graphics/datadog/body_snarky.svg){width=100px; height=100px}

I guess Wendy is right...we should take time to look at the graphs we make to see what is going on with the data. Let's make another graph with the sardine landings data. For this graph, the year variable will be on the x-axis and the variable "monterey_tons" will be on the y-axis.

```{r sardine_3}

plot(landings_df$year, landings_df$monterey_tons,                  
     type = "l",
     col  = "blue",
     main = "Landings (Tons) by Year",
     xlim = c(1915, 1970),
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Landings (Tons)")

```

## Smoothing Technique: Loess Line

![](../assets/web_lesson_graphics/statcat/head_static.svg){width=100px; height=100px}

StatCat here, let's try a smoothing technique called the loess line for the temperature dataset. To do this we need to create a temperature model, called loess. Then we can generate predicted values using that model, and lay down a smoothing line on top of the graph. 

```{r sardine_4}

# Model that fits mutliple regressions locally with 50% smoothing span.
temp_model <- loess(avg_temp ~ year, data = avg_temps_df, span = .50) 

# Predicted values from the loess model.
temp_line  <- predict(temp_model)

# Same plot as above with raw data.
plot(avg_temps_df$year, avg_temps_df$avg_temp,                   
     type = "l",
     col  = "blue",
     main = "Temperature by Year with Smoothed Data",
     xlim = c(1915, 1970),
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Temperature (Celsius)")

# Adds a line in red with predicted values.
lines(temp_line, x = avg_temps_df$year, col = "red")  

```

Let's use our smoothing skills again for the sardine landings dataset. You will be an expert in smoothing curves out like me in no time!

```{r sardine_5}

landing_model <- loess(monterey_tons ~ year, data = landings_df, span = .50)
landing_line  <- predict(landing_model)

plot(landings_df$year, landings_df$monterey_tons,                  
     type = "l",
     col  = "blue",
     main = "Landings by Year with Smoothed Data",
     xlim = c(1915, 1970),
     xlab = "Year",

Let's take a closer look at these graphs, Consultant **add number**. 

1. What do you observe from each of these line graphs with the loess lines?

2. Are you able to identify a better overall trend using the loess lines for the temperature and sardine landings variables?

3. Can you describe the relationship between the two variables better now with the loess lines?

4. What do you notice between the two line graphs? How do they compare? How are they different?

## Simple Linear Regression and Correlation

![](../assets/web_lesson_graphics/statcat/head_static.svg){width=100px; height=100px}

Now that we can better identify the trend of the temperature and sardine landings over the years, let's take a closer look at the relationship between these two variables. We know that sardines need an ideal temperature in order to catch and grow their population. In order to better understand the change in sardine landings over the years, we will use the temperature data to predict the amount of sardine landings. This type of technique is called linear regression.

## Raw Temperature and Landing Correlation and Regression

![](../assets/web_lesson_graphics/datadog/body_snarky.svg){width=100px; height=100px}

Whoah, hold on kitty. Before you go out and do all that fancy dancing we need to first join the two datasets of the raw average ocean temperatures and raw landings using the variable "year". Then, we need to retain only those years where the catch was greater than 500 tons. When the catch was less than 500 tons, the fishery was effectively shutdown so we don't want to have those years in our joined dataset. Finally, let's write some exceptional code to graph the data! Let's get started on subsetting that data with your exceptional coding skills.

## Merge and graph the raw data

```{r sardine_6}

# Combines the avg temp and landings data into one dataset by year.
analysis_raw_df <- merge(avg_temps_df, landings_df, by = "year") 

# Subset the dataset so that only landings of more than 500 tons are included.
analysis_raw_df <- subset(analysis_raw_df, monterey_tons > 500)

# Subset the dataset so that only years before 1954 are included.
analysis_raw_df <- subset(analysis_raw_df, year < 1954)

# Graph the dataset.
plot(x = analysis_raw_df$avg_temp, y = analysis_raw_df$monterey_tons, 
     xlab = "Surface Temp (Celsius)",
     ylab = "Landings (Tons)",
     main = "Landings (Tons) by Surface Temperature (Celsius)")

Consultant **add number**, I'm interested in hearing your thoughts about the regression line. 

1. How does the linear regression line compare to your estimated regression line?

2. Overall, what does Pearson's r and the simple linear regression model tells us about surface temperature as a predictor for the sardine catch?

---

![](../assets/web_lesson_graphics/statcat/head_static.svg){width=100px; height=100px}

That raw data correlation is pathetic! Let's try the same statistical techniques using the smoothed data. This will allow us to look at the overall trend of ocean temperature as a predictor for the sardine landings.

## Smoothed Temperature and Landing Regression & Correlation

![](../assets/web_lesson_graphics/wendy/head_happy.svg){width=100px; height=100px}

Now that we've conducted a simple linear regression and correlation value with the raw data, let's do the same with the smoothed data from our loess model. Let's see if you can apply what you learned in the previous section with the raw data to the smoothed data. With the smoothing line vectors, create two new dataframes. Add a "year" variable, populate it with values from 1917 to 1967, and then join both into an analysis dataframe. Remove rows from "analysis_df" for years when the fishery was shut down. Graph the new dataset.

## Merge and graph the smoothed data

Data Note:  landing_df and temp_df contain smoothed data.

```{r sardine_9}

# Create a dataframe with the smoothed data for the landings.

# Add a column in each dataset with the year.
landing_df$year <- 1917:1967
